This project uses React Bootstrap to style a basic blog page.

I was able to manage state, and pass props independently while working on this app. I assigned state in effective ways.

I would like to add Redux so that I can manage state more effectively. I think this would allow me to create a separate page for each post, create a comments section, and create an email signup form.
